## 🔧 How to Fix Email Notifications

### **Step 1: Configure Event Notifications**

1. **Go to your event customization page**:

### **Step 2: Verify Email Configuration**

The notification system will send emails to `info@edgecreative.net` when:
- ✅ A new ticket is purchased
- ✅ Payment is completed
- ✅ Order is confirmed

### **Step 3: Test the Setup**

2. **Check for notification email**:
   - Check `info@edgecreative.net` inbox

The notification emails will include:
- **Order summary** with ticket details
- **Customer information** (name, email, phone)
- **Custom question answers** (if any)
- **Total amount** and payment status
- **Event details** and date

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **If emails are not received**:
